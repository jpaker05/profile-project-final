            <p class="mb-5">
              My previous studies and degrees are in Archeology and Art History
              (undergrad), and Art Business (graduate). Art Buisness led me to
              an interest in the tech field along with a desire to be more
              mobile. I began my coding journey in August 2022 when I enrolled
              in a multi-certification coding bootcamp called SheCodes. Starting
              from the basics, I learned the foundations of HTML and CSS. Then I
              began learning JavaScript and further developing HTML and CSS
              techniques. After, I dove into loops and arrays, Bootstrap,
              Git/GitHub, and hosting on platforms such as Netlify.
              <br />
              <br />

              I hit a wall while coding my live weather application using APIs
              for the first time. Instead of calling it quits, I was determined
              to continue my coding journey. After a week of troubleshooting,
              searching Stack Overflow, and reaching out on Slack, I decided the
              best course of action was to destroy and re-build the entire
              application line-by-line. In the end, my application worked
              successfully but more importantly, I realized where my mistakes
              had been, how to make my code cleaner and more effective, and
              finally it was at this point, I knew my future lay in coding. For
              my next application using API's, I was then able to quickly build
              a live world clock application. From here I moved into learning
              how to make applications responsive across multiple platforms as
              well as being SEO friendly. My latest certification is in React.
              <br />
              <br />
              I look forward to working in an environment that is challenging
              and encouraging in furthering my coding development.
